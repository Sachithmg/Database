# Database

## 1. Social Media Platform Project

### Objective
- **ER Diagram Design:** Created an ER diagram for a social media platform with entities such as Users, Locations, Albums, Photos, Videos, Posts, and Comments.
- **Physical Model Implementation:** Converted the ER diagram to a MySQL-based relational database. Database tables were created and populated with records.
- **NoSQL Database:** Implemented the same system in MongoDB, writing equivalent queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

### Key Components
- **ER and Logical Model:** Clearly defined entity relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- **MySQL Implementation:** Populated tables with at least ten records each. Complex queries for inserting, deleting, updating, and retrieving information.
- **MongoDB Implementation:** Structured collections using document-oriented data, supporting flexible and scalable operations.
- **Execution:** Provided steps for executing MySQL scripts and MongoDB JavaScript files, with output verification through text files.

## 2. University Student Data Management System

### Objective
- **Design and Implement:** A University Student Data Management System using both MySQL and MongoDB.
- **Entities and Relationships:** Focus on core entities such as Students, Courses, Departments, Enrollments, and Semesters.

### Key Components
- **ER Diagram and Logical Model:** Defined entities and their relationships for both MySQL and MongoDB.
  - **MySQL Design:** Relational structure using normalized tables for data consistency and integrity.
  - **MongoDB Design:** Schema-less design using collections and documents for flexibility and scalability.
- **MySQL Implementation:** Database creation and population with tables such as Students, Courses, Departments, and Enrollments. SQL queries provided for complex operations and data retrieval.
- **MongoDB Implementation:** Created collections for the same entities with a document-based approach, optimizing for fast retrieval of embedded data.

### Queries and Analysis
- **Querying Both Systems:** Various complex queries implemented for both MySQL and MongoDB to retrieve, update, and analyze data, ensuring consistency in results across both systems.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Detailed comparison of schema design, query performance, scalability, and suitability between MySQL and MongoDB, highlighting the benefits and trade-offs of each approach.

## Execution Instructions
- **MySQL:** Step-by-step commands provided to execute the database scripts.
- **MongoDB:** Execution steps outlined for running MongoDB scripts via JavaScript files.
